## Ecological and evolutionary consequences of habitat selection
### Peter C. Zee // University of Mississippi

### Background/Question/Methods
Habitat selection is a critical demographic event for many organisms.  

Patch quality with
Context dependencies ...
Local and regional effects
obligate vs facultative dispersal

Structure of heterogeneity -- can be locally unstructured, but regionally structured (or vice versa)

In a metacommunity context, this habitat selection can have consequences for the pattern of diversity seen across a landscape (beta vs alpha).

This model tracks movement of individuals, , changes in community structure, and evolutionary changes.





### Results/Conclusions ##

At both the local and regional level,  find regional 
increased colonization in suitabable habitats in proximity to unsuitable habitats ('compression').

At the community (and metacommunity) level, we find that the context dependencies of habitat selection result in . In particular, we find that results in ... beta diversity.

Results from the simulation framework will be able to give predictions for habitat selection

Ongoing work aims to investigate how habitat selection evolves in populations encountering environments with heterogeneity in suitability in space and time.

The body of the abstract is up to 400 words, split between the two sections (up to 200 words each): Background/Question/Methods, in which the objective of the study is clearly identified and the methods are described; and Results/Conclusions, in which specific results of the study are explicitly reported and their implications for ecology are briefly discussed.
The abstract must report specific results. The results may be preliminary but they may not be vague. Abstracts without explicitly stated results will be rejected.
It is understandable that abstracts describing non-traditional work may lack quantitative data; however, it is still expected that the abstract will address some question and have a “take-home message” describing specific findings.
