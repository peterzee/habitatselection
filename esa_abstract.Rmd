### Background/Question/Methods

Understanding how environmental spatial heterogeneity impacts  .. 
Habitat selection is a critical demographic event for many organisms.  
Patch quality with
Context dependencies ...

I haev built stochastic, individual-based simulation model . In this spatially explicit model, individual organisms move across a landscape and make .. . Across a wide range of parameters . 


Further, the model can be exapnded to a community framework, where individuals of different species


In this way, I can study how 





In a metacommunity context, this habitat selection can have consequences for the pattern of diversity seen across a landscape (beta vs alpha).

This model tracks movement of individuals, , changes in community structure, and evolutionary changes.





### Results/Conclusions ##
In this
We found that a hetergenous environment, where perception matters...

Preliminary analyses show that interactions between the spatial scales of individual movement (local vs global dispersal) and the structure patch quality determine patterns of colonization. IN particular, we find


Structure of heterogeneity -- can be locally unstructured, but regionally structured (or vice versa)
Local and regional effects


Spatially explicit

At both the local and regional level,  find regional 

increased colonization in suitabable habitats in proximity to unsuitable habitats ('compression').

At the community (and metacommunity) level, we find that the context dependencies of habitat selection result in . In particular, we find that results in ... beta diversity.

Categorizing community structures by interactions between landscape structure and patterns of individual dispersal. Preliminary analyses show ...

Beta diversity increasesd in unsuitable patches, as decease

Together, these results identify interactions among across multiple levels of organizition (inviduals to communities).

At the community level, I find that habitat selection leads to . 

Results from the simulation framework will be able to give predictions for habitat selection

Ongoing work is investigating how the population and community structures that influence subsequent evolution of organismal traits involve in habitat selection.

The body of the abstract is up to 400 words, split between the two sections (up to 200 words each): Background/Question/Methods, in which the objective of the study is clearly identified and the methods are described; and Results/Conclusions, in which specific results of the study are explicitly reported and their implications for ecology are briefly discussed.
The abstract must report specific results. The results may be preliminary but they may not be vague. Abstracts without explicitly stated results will be rejected.
It is understandable that abstracts describing non-traditional work may lack quantitative data; however, it is still expected that the abstract will address some question and have a “take-home message” describing specific findings.
