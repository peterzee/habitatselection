## Ecological and evolutionary consequences of habitat selection
### Peter C. Zee // University of Mississippi

### Background/Question/Methods
Selecting a habitat is a critical demographic decision for many organisms. 

Patch quality with
Context dependencies ...
Local and regional effects

Structure of heterogeneity -- can be locally unstructured, but regionally structured (or vice versa)

In a metacommunity context, this habitat selection can have consequences for the pattern of diversity seen across a landscape (beta vs alpha).



### Results/Conclusions ##
In this
We found that a hetergenous environment, where perception matters....

Spatially explicit

Further, generalizing the model to the community level, we find that the context dependencies of habitat selection result in . In particular, we find that results in ... beta diversity.


This modeling frameworks integrates across behavior, community ecology, and evolution.

The body of the abstract is up to 400 words, split between the two sections (up to 200 words each): Background/Question/Methods, in which the objective of the study is clearly identified and the methods are described; and Results/Conclusions, in which specific results of the study are explicitly reported and their implications for ecology are briefly discussed.
The abstract must report specific results. The results may be preliminary but they may not be vague. Abstracts without explicitly stated results will be rejected.
It is understandable that abstracts describing non-traditional work may lack quantitative data; however, it is still expected that the abstract will address some question and have a “take-home message” describing specific findings.
