#Habitat selection in structured landscapes

##*compression*: 
-increased colonization rate caused by proximity of perceived low quality patches

-essentially, this makes the relatively higher quality patch even more likely to be colonized

-colonists are *compressed* into the patch

##*contagion*:
-colonization rate impacted by surrounding perceived patch quality

-can be positive (**reward contagion**) or negative (**risk contagion**)



Both compression and contagion can operate on local and regional scales


## Questions


Do the relative importance of contagion and compression change in different landscape structures?
Does this effect depend on risk vs reward contagion?


Landscape structures:random <-> gradient

relative rates of colonization dispersal between predator and prey?

aquatic systems vs terrestrial system?

Directionality of dispersal/colonization? Propagule rain (all patches) vs directional (flow)

Priority effects during assembly of a prey community?
